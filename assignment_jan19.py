# #What are the two values of a boolean data type. How do you write them.

# Python boolean type is one of the built-in data types provided by Python, which represents one of the two values i.e. True or False. Generally, it is used to represent the truth values of the expressions. For example, 1== 0 is True whereas 2<1 is False.

#What are the three boolean operators?

#AND
#OR
#NOT

#Write out the truth tables of both boolean operators i.e every possible combination of boolean values and their result.


#What are the six comparison operators.

# less than ( < ), less than or equal to ( <= ), greater than ( > ), greater than or equal to ( >= ), equal to ( == ), and not equal to ( != ).

#What is the difference between the equal operator and the assignment operator

# The difference between = (Assignment) and == (Equal to) operators. The “=” is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. The '==' operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true.
